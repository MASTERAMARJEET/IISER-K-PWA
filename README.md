## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository locally on your pc.

```bash
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/slashdot-iiserk/IISER-K-PWA.git <project name>
```

or

```bash
# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:slashdot-iiserk/IISER-K-PWA.git <project name>
```

Then follow the [Setup](##setup) section.

## Setup

**It is highly recommended that you use linux**. Some things might not work right away on Windows. If you are on Windows, you can use WSL.

- Make sure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) installed. You can check for the same by running `node -v` and `yarn -v`. If you have them installed you will get a version number without error.
- Run `yarn install`. This should install all necessary packages into a `node_modules` folder.
- Run `yarn dev` to see if you are able to run the react app. If you did not face
  any errors you are good to go.
